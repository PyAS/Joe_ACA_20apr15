Today, 2 April 2015.

Jeo is so generous that he gave me access to his Austin Coding Academy (ACA) ongoing tutorial series.
The series is Intro to Python.

There is a pdf, "JoeACA_syllabus_2apr15", to know the syllabus of this series.

IT IS POSSIBLE TO BECOME A DEVELOPER WITH THIS TUTORIAL, but with working out much more than required!

***********************************************************************
But remember, your aim is to become a SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING PROFESSIONAL, or a DATA SCIENTIST (not a data analyst)!

Check the pdf doc, "JoeConverse_2apr15.pdf" for email conversation with him until this day.

Happy Pythoning!
