# def Dim(Life):
##        # Dimensional Analysis on _Life_

## Too many directions at too many angles, but the question is, if there is just ONE Origin or more.

### This is an attempt to look at life from an aerial view.

And hope at the end of the analysis, to arrive at a sensible answer as if life is drawn on a flowchart kind of a thing.

But there is a danger with this aerial view. The farther I go from my target, more will be the chances that my vision results in illusions. For example, a lot of us see a deer on moon, a lot of them see a rabbit, or an old woman, etc. Illusions. The closer I look at it, there are still dangers of missing clarity and rising blur. Just for the fun of it, I am going to try to involve a lot of math and physics into this scribble.

Despite my age and my educational degrees, I still have problems in efficiently using spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems. I stick to the well known 3 dimensional _Descartes_.

Life can be resolved (viewed) into three mutually perpendicular components in this way with past, present and future on the three axes. So, it is sort of time's evolution forward from a single point. Now, here is some scientific problem. This picture suggests that time has an origin before which it never existed. As if time has(d) a beginning! No, I am not keeping such scientific nuances in mind when I do this analysis. After all, this is just an exercise to test if the results make my mind any better than it is now. So, anyway, they are mutually perpendicular which means they never actually meet other than connected somehow by the area between them. Sort of like walls meeting at their edges and corners!

Now the problem is that each of these axes has got its own configuration deep within. I mean, look at it this way. A line is just a collection of points. Let us constrain this by saying all those points on one line are of the same size, just to make things easier. But what if there are points of varied sizes within or around this line. So, making all those equi-sized points fall on a straight line will make a very complex maze-like structure. A vast edifice of randomly-thrown, randomly-long and randomly-think lines, randomly passing and crossing through one another at random positions and random angles. A depiction that can never be analyzed by any natural means that we know of so far. This is very much where this entire scribble is born.

Keep this math aside for a couple minutes. Consider someone's life. It's a man. Right now he is 33. But surely, about 33 years ago, he was 0 years old. And beyond doubt, he will be most perfectly 66 years old exactly after 33 more years. There is no way he could be 65 or even 62 years old after this period. It's impossible! It is just utterly impossible. There is such mathematical perfection maintained to such a superior level by whoever created this man.

But the question is, if this man was born out of so many mathematical calculations, why was he not created with a born mathematical and analytical part of mind? Why can't he be so good with math? After all, his every part of life, biologically, physically, chemically and socially, is perfectly mathematical. (Shall we give the credit to the emotional part of his life for this imperfection? I am not sure if that part is mathematical.) A lot of other men could prove this kind of hypotheses quantitatively. Then why not just this bunch of men like him? All this leads to the never-ending debate on the question, who's born first, math or man?

This man, when he was in school, never focused on learning. For anybody, it is like being kicked into the reality at once, immediately after school. As per the rules in this new world, life began throwing at him brutal challenges, which hindered his focus on learning again. On the contrary, he hears a lot of his well-wishers saying that these challenges are the ones that help him learn a lot about life. He could never feel it in the noise of reality.

At any point in this course, he never stopped dreaming. In fact, the only way you can identify this guy is as a perfect dreamer.

> Dream, dream, dream ... and more dreams!

Lost in the ecstasy of dreaming, he forgot the concept of achieving dreams. He kept his learning very low, almost nil. Thereby, he has a very well-maintained zero-confidence. As a result, he reached a point where his new awareness of the concept of achieving dreams couldn't help him much. But he is still dreaming. And there is one good side of his life. Currently 98.5% of his dreams revolve around learning various concepts. That's close to the mass ratio of the sun versus the entire solar system. ;-) Let me see his list of dreams for instance.

* Current affairs in the world do not let a man earn his bread without a certain set of qualities. As obvious, each element of this set is itself a set, which is subset of the main set. For instance, the man I am talking about lives in a generation that stands at the
cusp of previous and upcoming generations. So is the case perhaps in everybody's case. But the difference is in the intensity of the impacts generated by technological evolution that creates a broad metamorphosis in life and thought. Today's man has to have these technological skills even if he wants to be just a writer. This man dreams to own these skills one fine day. He is surely working on them but nothing strategically. The problem is, he doesn't know where to stop more than what he known about where to start.

* On the other side, this man has always been in inexplicable relation with science. Either he is in love with it that he wants to possess it, make it his identity. Or he simply is in awe of this subject. He envies everybody who made it in this field. He has more respect toward mathematics than anything else in his world. Perhaps, he failed at this subject more than he passed during any time of his entire education. He still loves her. Thanks to either his teachers who instilled this passion in his head, or thanks to the subject itself which has an irreversible effect on his head, or thanks to his mind which has an inherent liking for this kind of subjects. Whatever, he dreams of owning an identity by which he could identify himself with science.

* On the third side, he has his personal baggage of obligations. He is not living a common life. At least, that's how he describes it. Most of his peers are dwelling their lives amidst a torrent of thoughts regarding economical savings and investments, life's usual responsibilities, etc. He doesn't find in them so much crave for learning anymore. He thinks he is clearly seeing in them an innate talent to manage with what they already know. Also, he heard a lot of his well-wishers tell him that compromise is the key. Often, he fails to be in terms with them.

* This man, however, does not have enough privileges to think of such things. He has a myriad of complications on the economical front of his life. This one set of complications usually influences
  - how he thinks about his life and any life in general,
  - the way he handles his relationships and any relationships in general,
  - the way he wakes up and sleeps, just about the whole nature of his sleep in general

Etc.! A lot of his peers asked him questions that prompted him to question his fundamental nature whether he is being a weak man who allows all segments of his life to be influenced by just one set of complications in one facet of life. Often times, he avoids debate with such people, partly because he knows they are not truly interested in this debate and partly due to shortage of any convincing answer.

* He also has demands from his current job for new learnings. His current job seems like a roller-coaster ride because he is made to rethink his abilities at every single minute based on which he was chosen for that position. Most of these demanded set of learning are out of the Venn circle of his interests. His mind always refuses to cooperate even if he pleads and begs. Due to this, his new learnings can be counted but not applied. With so many complications, he is obviously not chosen by any other professional company in the world but this one where he currently works.

> __With this, what is the probability that this man could ever be able to analyze his own life's complex web of causes and effects, let alone the possibility of him being an intelligent problem-solver, a personality that his kids could look to or a teacher for a student of any caliber?__

We can also consider his inabilities in this mathematical scenario. He has a track record of failing to manage time. But as said, he was born in conditions where his traditional style of dealing with time sufficed in most cases until he was in school. The reality he saw post that was a world way different from what he was brought up in. This is the world where you not only afford to lose opportunities, but you cannot really find them, first of all.

Now that brings in a discussion on his inability of adapting to strange environments, which according to a lot of today's job descriptions and requirements, is a negative mark. His inability in calculating anything has been mentioned at the beginning of this scribble anyway.

Art of Calculating is what makes up one's managing ability, analytical ability and therefore problem-solving ability. He never bothered about practicing to calculate the amount of time he needs to get a work done, the amount of food he needs to get a work done, and the amount of practice he needs to get a work done.

> __Calculation is the key of life.__

At the end, the title of this scribble is in computer programming language whose base is mathematical logic. The content is written partially in mathematical language. The question of probability above is purely math. And the answer is of course math. The analysis so far hints that if this man works on his math skills that are directly applicable in real life, the so called __"Ground Zero"__, he is sure to win the race. A similar but a bit more tedious analysis would prove that this man would be able to find god and the meaning of life if he could possess such mathematical abilities.

#### Despite all this, this man still dreams of having an hour of solitude each day, and he never works towards it.

#### He still fails to remember calculating his 24 hours with respect to the number of goals (dreams) he has in his mind.
