# Joe's Intro to Python

Today, 20 April 2015.

I am learning Python from Austin Coding Academy (ACA) tutorial series.
The series is: __Intro to Python__.

The [tutorial](http://python.austincodingacademy.com/) needs credentials.

***********
* I keep telling myself, 

> Remember! The aim is to become a __SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING PROFESSIONAL__, or a __DATA SCIENTIST__, no matter how long it takes!

	'''
	Self is certainly me! ;-)
	But it can take anybody in it's place.
	Spiritual essence of self can be seen here in computing world.
	Particularly Python.
	If there is self, the "methods" follow!
	The methods are chosen by whoever the Self is!
